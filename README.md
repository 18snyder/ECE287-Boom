# ECE287-Boom
This is our ECE287 bomb disarming project, Boom!
This project is a game that uses finite state machines, a counter, and VGA all on the 
FPGA Cyclone II board using verilog.
All of the details and intructions for the game are on the wiki page. 
top.v is the main module that was used in our bomb game. 
logic.v and counter.v are breakdowns of pieces of the top.v module.
